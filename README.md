### Description
An application for technical documentation. A cloud-based PERN stack application for managing, archiving and sharing technical documentation for a sales team.

### Technical Stack
React.js
Node.js
Express.js
React Query
Redux Tool Kit
Styled Components
AWS SDK
Passport.js with JWT
PG for PostgreSQL

### What and Why
The purpose of this application was to centralize the process of saving, renaming, storing, managing, retrieving, and sharing technical documentation received via email or fax. By providing a centralized platform, the application aimed to enhance the efficiency of the sales team's workflow.

### How
For the core of the project, I selected React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database management. To ensure reliable and secure storage, I integrated AWS S3 as the storage provider.

### What Happened
One of the major challenges I encountered was generating thumbnails of PDF files using external libraries that utilized C++. Through dedicated study and effort, I successfully resolved this issue on both MacOS and Windows platforms.

During the project, I gained valuable insights and skills, such as working with file manipulation using blobs, filtering large datasets efficiently, and integrating AWS services into the application.

## mini crm
### Description
An application for managing customers interactions, and aggregating data on a map.

### Technical Stack
React.js
Node.js
Express.js
Styled Components
Passport.js with JWT
PG for PostgreSQL
Google Maps API
Browser Location API

### What and Why
This application aimed to address the challenge of effectively managing and visualizing a large volume of leads and customer data. By providing a map-based interface, sales representatives could conveniently view nearby locations and access essential information such as sales reports and quotes, thereby empowering them in their day-to-day activities.

### How
To develop this project, I opted for React as the frontend framework due to its component-based architecture, enabling the creation of reusable UI components. For handling relational data, PostgreSQL was chosen as the database management system. Additionally, the Google Maps API was utilized to integrate maps and location-related features into the application.

### What Happened
The initial challenges I faced included setting up authentication and efficiently rendering thousands of markers on the Google Maps API. Overcoming these hurdles allowed me to enhance the application's functionality and create a seamless user experience.


## Japanible
### Description
Japanible is a web 2 public blogging platform, catering to individuals who have something to say or are interested about Japan, its culture, and language.

### Technical Stack
React.js later Next.js
TipTap WYSIWYG
Firebase Auth
Firebase Storage
Firebase Database

### What and Why
I always wanted to give back to the community. And as a portfolio project, I decided to make a bigger entertaining and educational site to learn Japanese. In the first stage I chose to make a blogging part that would be similiar to note.com in Japan, or Medium overseas, to attract people. In the second stage, I am currently working on a spaces repetition language learning part (similiar to Duolingo, Anki etc. using a supermemo algorithm).

### How
For this originally portfolio project I chose React.js and Firebase, because I wanted to learn how to work with Firebase platform. However, I would have chosen Next.js and other storage and database nowadays. I want to rewrite the project into Next.js in the future, however right now, I am hosting it on Render.com and I am using Prerenderer for SEO.

### What Happened
The biggest challenge was to implement a WYSIWYG editor for blog posts, I have tried many options out there and settled with this one. Current biggest challenge of this project is the server side rendering that is not included in CRA.


## PUR CHER
### Description
A SPA product landing page.

### Technical Stack
Next.js
Styled-components
Mailer for the contact form

### What and Why
The purpose of this project was to create a presentation page specifically targeting English-speaking international buyers from hotels and gift shops. The SPA design aimed to provide a simple and user-friendly way to showcase the product and its features. Additionally, the website included a Nodemailer contact form, allowing buyers to directly place orders on the website.

### How
To build this project, I utilized Next.js, React-Hook-Form, and Styled-Components for the frontend. For the contact form, Nodemailer was implemented. Moreover, I challenged myself by incorporating TypeScript into the project.

### What Happened
Throughout this project, I acquired knowledge on sending emails with Node.js and basic TypeScript usage.

## Sensyo Co., Ltd.
### Description
A vanilla redesign of a Metal Surface Finisher website.

### Technical Stack
Bootstrap CSS
Vanilla Javascript
External JS libraries

### What and Why
The goal of this project was to give the existing website a more modern and globally appealing look. Additionally, the project aimed to enable news posting functionality for the team. As the sole developer responsible for the redesign, I shifted the website's focus from primarily targeting job seekers to adopting a more client-focused approach that highlighted services and technologies. In addition to the website redesign, I collaborated with another person to create a fresh and modern logo for the company.

### How
For this project, I relied on HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript due to their simplicity and the possibility of enabling non-technical team members to contribute to website development.

### What Happened
To ensure easy content editing and allow any team member to post news, I implemented a vanilla stack. Additionally, I incorporated a headless MicroCMS for seamless content management.

## backslack
### Description
An UI for Slack backup through Slack Bot; built as an alternative to paid applications.

### Technical Stack
Slack API
React.js

### What and Why
The purpose of this application was to provide a solution for backing up one Slack workplace without relying on paid apps or manual chat copying.

### How
Due to time constraints, I opted to develop a Slack bot with necessary OAuth permissions, allowing data retrieval from Slack.

### What Happened
The primary challenge in this project was deciphering the structure of the Slack API. Particularly, fetching data from private channels proved to be a struggle. By seeking assistance on platforms like Stack Overflow, I was able to find answers outside the official documentation, enabling the successful completion of this feature.

Effective communication with backend engineers played a crucial role throughout the project.

## SMOSS
### Description
A no-code application that helps managing production in-realish time with step-by-step system.

### Technical Stack
Appsheet
Google Sheets as Database
QR Codes

### What and Why
This application marked the beginning of my journey as a developer. It originated from a simple question posed to me: "Jonas, couldn't you find a way to make this easier?" Rather than creating another Excel macro sheet, I set out to explore the best solution. Over the course of a month, I built an MVP while continuously collaborating with over five individuals to refine the features. The challenge of finding the optimal solution within a specific timeframe was energizing, and the eventual adoption of the application by teams for over a year and a half was highly rewarding. Although the application was eventually phased out, the positive feedback from colleagues and friends, who could no longer imagine working without it, remains a cherished memory.

### How
Due to my limited technical knowledge at the time, I chose a no-code application as the fastest and most efficient solution, akin to Excel macros. I selected AppSheet for its intuitive user experience. Since AppSheet utilizes Google APIs, integrating Google Sheets as a database for the project was seamless.

### What Happened
One of the technical challenges I faced during this project was my lack of knowledge in app development. To overcome this hurdle, I dedicated myself to researching and learning the best tools available. The target audience for this project was to create an app that could connect customer service, sales, procurement, and the manufacturing line in real-time, reducing the reliance on telephonic communication. The app continued to be used by two factories for almost two years.

Developing no-code applications provided me with a simplified understanding of full-stack development, including data structuring and view creation. Additionally, the availability of documentation and forums discussing features such as barcode scanning prepared me for real-life development challenges.

## b2b.wiki (building)
### Description
A platform for business matching based on data aggregated from government APIs and user generated content.

### Technical Stack
Next.js
Public Government API data
OAuth

### What and Why
In Japan, numerous business matching and comparison platforms exist (such as Emidas, iPros, Metoree, etc.). However, I found them unintuitive and lacking essential functions. The goal of this project is to create a competitor platform where users can find businesses based on legal ID, product, methodology, and industry categories. The platform provides extensive filtering options and allows users to create custom lists.

### How
For this project, I chose Next.js and a NoSQL database.

### What Happened
The current challenge in this project revolves around retrieving and linking data from two main Japanese governmental APIs while maintaining optimal rendering performance.

Continuous learning remains a key aspect of my development journey.
